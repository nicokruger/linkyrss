## Key Features ðŸŒŸ

- **AI-Generated Summaries:** Don't just store links, get a concise and informative summary of the content. 

- **RSS Feed:** Access your bookmarks anytime, anywhere using your favorite RSS reader. Stay updated on your saved content effortlessly.

- **Automated Title and Summary:** Simply provide a link and LinkyRSS will automatically generate a suitable title and summary.

- **Effective Categorization & Search:** Tired of losing important links in a disorganized mess? With LinkyRSS, you can leverage your existing RSS tagging mechanism.

## System Design ðŸ§©

LinkyRSS is designed to be simple yet robust. At its core, it's a Flask application. It leverages Langchain to utilize AI language models like GPT from OpenAI to generate summaries and titles for links. At the moment, data is stored in either an in-memory database or a DynamoDB database (easy to extend for other database systems).

Routes available in the application are:
- `/` : Home page showing count of links saved.
- `/api/extract` : Post a URL here to extract its title and summary.
- `/view` : View all stored links with their titles and summaries.
- `/rss` : RSS feed of all stored links. RSS 2.0 XML compatible with all popular RSS readers.

## Adding LinkyRSS to Your Feed Reader ðŸ“‘

Adding your LinkyRSS feed to your favorite feed reader is easy. Here's how you can do it:

1. Run your LinkyRSS application. Ensure it's either hosted on a server or running locally.

2. Navigate to the `/rss` endpoint of your LinkyRSS application. For instance, if you're running it locally on port 8080, the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/rss`.

3. Copy this URL.

4. Open your feed reader. The process of adding a new feed may vary between different feed readers. Generally, look for an option to "Add New Feed" or "Subscribe".

5. Paste the copied URL into the feed URL input box.

6. Confirm and add the feed.

Now, your LinkyRSS feed should be added to your feed reader. The reader will update with new bookmarks as they are added to your LinkyRSS.
